    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 lbs. skin-on, bone-in chicken</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp honey</li>
            <li>2 whole bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp minced garlic (about 2 cloves)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp black peppercorns</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange the chicken pieces in a large pot in one layer. Remove the skin if desired.</li>
            <li>Combine the rest of the ingredients (soy sauce, vinegar, honey, oil, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns) in a bowl and whisk until the honey is dissolved. Partially crush the peppercorns if desired. 
                    Pour the marinade over the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours or over night.</li>
            <li>When youâ€™re ready to make the chicken, add just enough water so that the liquid comes just up to the top of the chicken (about 1/2 cup). Cover the pot with a lid, place the pot over a high flame, and bring it up to a rolling boil. 
                    When it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium/low and let simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat your broiler on high. Remove the chicken from the pot and place it on a broiler pan (or a sheet pan with wire cooling racks placed on top). Place the chicken under the broiler until it is brown and crispy on top (5-10 minutes), depending on your broiler).</li>
            <li>While the chicken is broiling, turn pot with the soy/vinegar liquid up to high and bring up to a rapid boil. Allow the liquid to boil heavily until it is reduced in volume by approximately one half. You may need to boil it for 5-10 minutes longer than the chicken is in the oven to get it to this point.</li>
            <li>Use a soft brush to baste a few layers of the reduced soy/vinegar liquid onto the browned chicken. Serve over rice or noodles and spoon more of the reduced liquid over top.</li>
         </ol>
